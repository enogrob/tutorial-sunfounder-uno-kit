# SunFounder Mega2560/UNO Kit¶ (https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/uno-mega-kit/en/latest/#sunfounder-mega2560-uno-kit)

With this kit, we will walk you through the know-how of using the SunFounder board in a hands-on way. Starting with the basics of electronics, you’ll learn through building several creative projects. Including a selection of the most common and useful electronic components, this kit will help you “control” the physical world.

If you want to learn another projects which we don’t have, please feel free to send Email and we will update to our online tutorials as soon as possible, any suggestions are welcomed. Here is the Email: service@sunfounder.com (mailto:service%40sunfounder.com).
